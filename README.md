Data literacy for textual analysis

Data Litercy 

Digital or data literacy can be defined as a way to think critically about data, or numbers issued by analysis. 

Textual data literacy is the ability to transform automatically big quantities of text into numerical data through applied statistical methods.

The ACRL (Association of College Research Libraries) already in 2015 advised to go beyond information literacy, incorporating also data information literacy to courses addressed to students. 

Moreover nowadays, "Textual retrieval", or the ability to retrieve information from information extracted from texts, is considered relevant, to inferr from textual data analysis trends and patterns about contents.

    "## Data types \n",
    "Broadly speaking data can be quantitatives or qualitatives, or numbers vs. text, but there are more data types if we consider the programming language. For instance numbers can also be called \"intergers\", if whole numbers, or \"floats\" if they are measured in fractions. Text, or textual data can be called \"Strings\" and they consists in letters.\n",
    "In a \"flow control\", or the line of commands asking the computer to do something, the result of the application of boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) can results in two other data types: TRUE or FALSE.\n",
    "A \"list\" is a way to store different data types and million of items in a ordered way. Finally a \"data structure\" is how information can be stored inside a program.\n",

    "## Some data file formats \n",
    "* Tabular data, or data organized in raws and colums, CSV files with the (.csv) extension, or Excel files (former proprietory now an open file format) with the .(.xlsx)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Textual data, or text files with the extension (.txt) with only text and no formatting (a word file is a formatted one), Portable Document file with the extension (.pdf)\n",
