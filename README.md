Data literacy for textual analysis

## Data Litercy 

Digital or data literacy can be defined as a way to think critically about data, or numbers issued by analysis. 

Textual data literacy is the ability to transform automatically big quantities of text into numerical data through applied statistical methods.

The ACRL (Association of College Research Libraries) already in 2015 advised to go beyond information literacy, incorporating also data information literacy to courses addressed to students. 

Moreover nowadays, "Textual retrieval", or the ability to retrieve information from information extracted from texts, is considered relevant, to inferr from textual data analysis trends and patterns about contents.

## Data in general and in the programming language 

Broadly speaking data can be quantitatives or qualitatives, or in other words numbers or texts (unstructured data), howether if we consider the programming language, there are more kind of data, or "data types". 
For instance numbers are "intergers", if whole numbers, or "floats" if they are measured in fractions. 
Text, or textual data can be called "strings", as they consist in letters (for a computer simply signs).

In a "flow control", or the line of commands asking the computer to perform something, the result of the application of boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) produces two other data types: TRUE or FALSE.

A "list" is a way to store different data types, possibly million of items in a ordered way, and a "data structure" is how information can be stored inside a program.

## Files and files formats

Some kind of data file formats are:

Tabular data, or data organized in raws and colums, CSV files with the (.csv) extension, or Excel files (former proprietory, now an open file format) with the extension .(.xlsx)\n".

Unstructured data, textual data, or text files with the extension (.txt) with only text and no formatting (a word file is a formatted one), Portable Document file with the extension (.pdf),
Images, of images contained in files, or JPG with the extension (.jpg), or (.png)\n", other files used for the data interchange: Markup HyperText Markup Language (.html), eXten
