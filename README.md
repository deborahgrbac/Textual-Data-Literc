    "Digital or data literacy can be defined as a way to think critically about numbers issued by analysis. Some textual data literacy, or the ability to transform automatically big quantities of text into numerical data through applied statistical methods, is becoming more and more important. The ACRL (Association of College Research Libraries, 2015) advises to go bend information literacy, incorporating data information literacy to courses addressed to students. Moreover, \"Textual retrieval\" is considered relevant, or the ability to retrieve information from information extraction, or inferring from textual data analysis trends and patterns.\n",

    "## Data types \n",
    "Broadly speaking data can be quantitatives or qualitatives, or numbers vs. text, but there are more data types if we consider the programming language. For instance numbers can also be called \"intergers\", if whole numbers, or \"floats\" if they are measured in fractions. Text, or textual data can be called \"Strings\" and they consists in letters.\n",
    "In a \"flow control\", or the line of commands asking the computer to do something, the result of the application of boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) can results in two other data types: TRUE or FALSE.\n",
    "A \"list\" is a way to store different data types and million of items in a ordered way. Finally a \"data structure\" is how information can be stored inside a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some data file formats \n",
    "* Tabular data, or data organized in raws and colums, CSV files with the (.csv) extension, or Excel files (former proprietory now an open file format) with the .(.xlsx)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Textual data, or text files with the extension (.txt) with only text and no formatting (a word file is a formatted one), Portable Document file with the extension (.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Images, of images contained in files, or JPG with the extension (.jpg), or (.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* other files used for the data interchange: Markup HyperText Markup Language (.html), eXten
